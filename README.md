## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
Currently, I'm a PhD student in the Graduate Program of Computer Science of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). I'm also a scholarship holder in the Ceos project, a partnership between UFSC and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Santa Catarina (MPSC) with the aim of researching and creating data science workflows that can improve decision making related to the MPSC's internal activities.

My research interests involve the use and development of new machine learning and data science methodologies to improve the detection of fraudulent behavior in government procurement.
